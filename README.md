Techdegree project 2 submitted by Daniel Balabis

Description: 
Write a program that organizes a list of student names, photos, and emails, having 10 students on each page. My solution to this problem needs to be able to account for any number of students. I will also need to create links at the bottom of the page so the user can see other students, 10 at a time.

Skills / Techniques:
I'll use psuedocode to allow me to map out and keep my code organized. I will seperate my code into more manageable chunks and check repeatedly to see if my code is functioning. I will also clean up my code once I have everything working to allow it to be easy to read and understand by others.
